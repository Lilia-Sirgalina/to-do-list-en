## Project Description

This application allows users to create a to-do list and cross out completed tasks.  
The app is built with React using Vite. 
The application uses class components.
To-do list items are added using the Add button. When the button is clicked, the new item is added to the listArray array using the .push() method and displayed in the <li> list using the .map() method.

When a list item is clicked, the .crossed class is applied to it, which marks the item as crossed out in red.
When the Delete button is pressed, the list is cleared and all items are removed.

No installation is required.
